```
k3s
```

<!-- Start Script --> 
Kubernetes, hereafter referred to as `k8s`, is a complex distributed system that can present a high barrier to entry.
`k3s` is a product that was designed at Rancher Labs to reduce this barrier.

```
What is k3s?
```

<!-- Start Script --> 
How has `k3s` reduced the complexity of `k8s` you ask? Well first and foremost, `k3s` has consolidated the distributed components of `k8s` into a single lightweight binary.
<!-- End Script -->

```
How is k3s different from k8s?
```

<!-- Start Script --> 
`k3s` allows you to leverage common seequill datastores instead of the traditional etseedee.
`k3s` can be configured with a standard directory to automatically install `k8s` workloads when `k3s` is started.
<!-- End Script -->

```
When would I use k3s?
```

<!-- Start Script --> 
You've heard me say that `k3s` is lightweight. The small size and requirements of `k3s` make it ideal for edge devices. It will work on ARM and x-eighty-six architectures alike.
